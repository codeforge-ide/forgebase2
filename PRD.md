## Executive Summary

ForgeBase2 is an open-source, all-in-one fullstack platform designed to compete with and surpass Firebase, Supabase, and Vercel. Built entirely in Rust, ForgeBase2 delivers exceptional performance, memory safety, and developer experience while providing a unified platform for backend services, database management, authentication, storage, serverless functions, and edge deployment.

### Vision Statement

To democratize modern application infrastructure by providing a lightning-fast, secure, and developer-friendly open-source platform that eliminates vendor lock-in and reduces infrastructure complexity.

### Key Differentiators

- **Pure Rust Implementation:** Leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency guarantees
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in:** Fully open-source with self-hosting capabilities
- **Unified Platform:** Single platform replacing multiple services and vendors
- **Edge-First Architecture:** Built for edge computing and global distribution
- **Developer Experience:** Intuitive APIs, comprehensive CLI, and excellent documentation
- **Cost Efficiency:** Dramatically reduced infrastructure costs through efficiency gains

---

## Problem Statement

Modern application development requires integrating multiple complex services:
- Backend infrastructure and APIs (Vercel, Netlify)

- Real-time subscriptions (Pusher, Ably)

This fragmentation leads to:
- High operational complexity and cognitive overhead
- Vendor lock-in and unpredictable costs
- Integration challenges and maintenance burden
- Performance overhead from service boundaries
- Security vulnerabilities across multiple systems
